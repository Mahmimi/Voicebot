# Insurance Voicebot

**During my internship at I&I Group Public Company Limited (IIG) in Chiang Mai**, I was involved in this project. This speak-able AI project aims to replace human call centers for selling insurance property. We developed a voice bot leveraging Text-to-Speech (TTS), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies.
